# 100 Days of Web Design

In order for me to get a lot of practice with web design, I'm going to create a new web project every day for 100 days using new tools or tool I am not very familiar with.

## Day 1 - SASS

Today I did a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) newbie level project. The project I did was [Order Summary Component](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/order-summary-component-QlPmajDUj).

### What is SASS

Ssss or Scss is a Css preprocesser that adds extra functionality, like loops and nested styles, to Css. Sass is used to make Css easier to read and write.

### What is the project

The goal of the challenge is to take the image of the order summary card provided by Frontend Mentor and recreate it on my own using whatever tools I wish to use. I also needed to add hover states for all the interactive elements.

This project was a very simple project that I chose to start the 100 days with, because I want to start of simple and work my way towards more difficult projects.

### Will I continue to use SASS

Yes. Using Sass makes working on bigger projects easier and more understandable
